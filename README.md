## Spring 2021 Web Development Challenge - Die Roller

This is the first project in my [Spring 2021 - Web Development Challenge](https://10in30.alexander-morse.com/) series, where I am attempting to design, code, and ship ten different web projects in the space of one month, under a variety of constraints.

For my first project, I've decided to visit Vue.js and build a simple web application using the Vue CLI tool. This is a simple die-rolling application that allows users to set up and execute custom dice rolls.
